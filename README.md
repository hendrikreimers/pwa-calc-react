PWA Calculator (React Version)
==============

This is my first REACT Project. Rebuild my Calculator Progressive Web App (PWA).

The click handling, and calculation is not the best solution, i think.
Because the handling to of the "state" and "clickHandler" to the child components and classes,
could be done easier with __REACT-REDUX__. Maybe next time ;-)

Enjoy and feel free to give me Feedback!
